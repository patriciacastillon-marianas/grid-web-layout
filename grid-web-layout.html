        <h2>Final Website Name</h2>
        <h3>The Local Hut</h3>
        <p>I am planning to feature a few of the hot local businesses on saipan right now. Most small businesses on island only have instagram accounts and no actual website for themselves, so I think it would be cool to create a website that would give them a spotlight. </p>
